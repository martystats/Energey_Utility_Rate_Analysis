# 👩‍💼 Employee Earnings Analysis — EDA + Linear Regression Model

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores employee compensation data to predict quarterly gross pay using Linear Regression.  
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end data-science workflow — from cleaning and EDA to modeling and evaluation.

## 🧩 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed missing values, standardized column names, verified data types.  
2. **EDA:** Visualized salary distributions, departmental trends, and correlations.  
3. **Modeling:** Trained and evaluated a Linear Regression model (R² ≈ 0.28).  
4. **Insights:** Base salary was the strongest predictor of total earnings.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
Python · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Scikit-learn · Jupyter Notebook

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
3. Run the notebook sequentially to reproduce results.
